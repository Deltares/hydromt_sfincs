v1.0 (17 April 2023)
====================

This release is a major update of the SfincsModel interface. It contains many new features,
such as support for *rotated grids*, *subgrid* and improved support for *building models from Python* scripts.
The documentation and exmaples have been updated to reflect these changes.

The release however also contains several breaking changes as we have tried to improve the
consistency of the interface and match it more closely to the SFINCS model itself.
Please carefully check the API reference for the new methods and arguments.

Main differences
----------------
- `setup_region` has been replaced by `setup_grid_from_region` and  `setup_grid`.
  This method actually creates an empty regular grid based on a region of interest or user-defined coordinates, shape, rotation, etc..
- `setup_dep` has replaced `setup_topobathy` and `setup_merge_topobathy`.
  This method can now also be used to setup a bathymetry map from multiple sources at once.
- `setup_mask_active` has replaced `setup_mask`.
- `setup_mask_bounds` has replaced `setup_bounds`
- `setup_waterlevel_forcing` has replaced `setup_h_forcing` and now supports merging fording from several data sources
- `setup_discharge_forcing` has replaced `setup_q_forcing` and now supports merging fording from several data sources
- `setup_discharge_forcing_from_grid` has replaces `setup_q_forcing_from_grid`
- `setup_precip_forcing` has replaced `setup_p_forcing`
- `setup_precip_forcing_from_grid` has replaced `setup_p_forcing_from_grid`
- `setup_observation_points` has replace `setup_gauges`

Added
-----------
- `setup_grid` to setup a user-defined regular grid based coordinates, shape, rotation, etc.
- `setup_subgrid` to setup subgrid tables (sbgfile) based on one ore more elevation and Manning roughness datasets
- `setup_constant_infiltration` to setup a constant infiltration rate maps (qinffile)
- `setup_waterlevel_bnd_from_mask` to setup water level boundary points (bndfile) based on the SFINCS model mask (mskfile)
- `setup_tiles` to create tiles of the model for fast visualization

Changed
---------------
- `setup_river_inflow` and `setup_river_outflow` are now based river centerline data (which can be derivded from hydrography data).
  This is more robust compared to the previous method which was based on reprojected flow direction data.

Removed (not replaced)
------------------------------
- `setup_basemaps` This method was already deprecated in v0.2.1 and has now been removed.
- `setup_river_hydrography` This method was removed as reprojection of the hydrography data is no longer required for river inflow/outflow.
- `setup_river_bathymetry` This method was removed as river bathymetry should ideally be burned in the subgrid data of the model rather
  than the dep file itself to be able to include rivers with widths smaller than the model grid cell size. A new option to burn rivers
  in the subgrid data will be added in to `setup_subgrid` a future release.


New low-level classes
---------------------
These classes are not intended to be used directly by the user, but are used internally by the SfincsModel class.

- The `SfincsInput` class contains methods to generate, read and write SFINCS input files
- The `RegularGrid` class contains methods to create and manipulate regular grids
- The `SubgridTableRegular` class contains methods to create and manipulate subgrid tables for regular grids


v0.2.1 (23 February 2022)
=========================

Deprecated
----------
- **setup_basemaps** has been replaced by **setup_topobathy**
- In **setup_mask**, the "active_mask_fn" argument has been renamed to "mask_fn" for consistency
- In **setup_river_inflow** and **setup_river_outflow** the "basemaps_fn" argument has been renamed to "hydrography_fn" for consistency
- In **setup_river_outflow** the "outflow_width" argument has been renamed to "river_width" for consistency with setup_river_inflow
- **setup_q_forcing_from_grid** and **workflows.snap_discharge** have a "rel_error" and "abs_error" argument instead of a single "max_error" argument.

Bugfix
------
- bugfix **setup_p_forcing** to ensure the data is 1D when passed to set_forcing_1d method
- bugfix **setup_p_forcing_from_grid** when aggregating with a multi polygon region.
- bugfix **read_results** with new corner_x/y instead of edge_x/y dimensions in sfincs_map.nc

New
---
- **setup_region** method to set the (hydrological) model region of interest (before part of **setup_basemaps**).
- **setup_river_hydrography** allows to derive hydrography data ['flwdir', 'uparea'] from the model elevation or reproject it from a global dataset.
  Derived 'uparea' and 'flwdir' maps are saved in the GIS folder and can be reused later (if kept together with the model)
- **setup_river_bathymetry** to estimate a river depth based on bankfull discharge and river width. A mask of river cells 'rivmsk' is kept in the GIS folder.
- Added parameter mapping file for ESA Worldcover dataset

Changed
-------
- **setup_mask** and **setup_bounds** both have a "mask_fn", "include_mask_fn" and "exclude_mask_fn" polygon and "min_elv" and "max_elv" elevation arguments to determine valid / boundary cells.
- **setup_mask** and **setup_bounds** have a "reset_mask" and "reset_bounds" option respectively to start with a clean mask or remove previously set boundary cells.
- **setup_mask** takes a new "drop_area" argument to drop regions of contiguous cells smaller than this maximum area threshold, useful to remove (spurious) small islands.
- **setup_mask** takes a new "fill_area" argument to fill regions of contiguous cells below the "min_elv" or above "max_elv" threshold surrounded by cells within the valid elevation range.
- In **setup_bounds** and **setup_mask** a "connectivity" argument is exposed to determine whether edge cells or regions of contiguous cells should be based on D4 (horizontal and vertical) or D8 (also diagonal) connections.
- In **setup_bounds** we avoid open boundary cells (mask == 3) next to water level boundary cells (mask == 2)
- **setup_merge_topobathy** has a new "max_width" argument to use bathymetry data from new source within a fixed width around the topography data.
- **setup_river_inflow** and **setup_river_outflow** are now based on the same **workflows.river_boundary_points** method.
   Both have a "river_upa" and "river_len" argument and the hydrography data is not required if **setup_river_hydrography** is ran beforehand.
   The model domain is also determined on-the-fly, thus it is not required to run setup_mask beforehand.
- **setup_river_inflow** has a new "river_width" argument to ensure closed boundary cells near a discharge source location
- **write_config** has a new "rel_path" argument that allows you to write sfincs.inp with references to model files in the root and rel_path directory.
- Write dep file with cm accuracy. This should be sufficient but also hides differences between linux and window builds.
- Exposed "interp_method" argument in **setup_merge_topobathy** to select interpolation method to fill NaNs.
- **setup_cn_infiltration** and **setup_manning_roughness** use default values for river cells as defined in **setup_river_bathymetry**
- The **setup_manning_rougness** has a new "sea_man" argument to set a constant roughness for cells below zero elevation.
- An improved version of interbasins **region** option has been implemented, see hydroMT core v0.4.5 for details.
- Bumped minimal pyflwdir version to 0.5.5
- Use mamba to setup CI environments


v0.2.0 (2 August 2021)
======================

Bugfix
------
- scsfile variable changed to maximum soil moisture retention [inch]; was curve number [-]
- fix setting delimited text based geodatasets for h and q forcing.

Changed
-------
- Bumped minimal hydromt version to 0.4.2
- splitted ``setup_topobathy`` into multiple smaller methods: ``setup_merge_topobathy``, ``setup_mask`` and ``setup_bounds``
- separated many low-level methods into utils.py and plots.py
- save bzs/bzd & dis/src only as GeoDataArray at forcing and do not copy the locations at staticgeoms.
- sort src/bnd files on x_dim for comparability between OS
- staticmaps are by default saved (and read) in S->N orientation as this matches the SFINCS better.
